# AI Agent Prototype: Email Triage

This project is an AI agent that can reason, plan, and execute the task of triaging an email inbox. It uses a fine-tuned Gemma 2B model (using LoRA) as a specialist tool for classification.

## Project Structure

-   `agent.py`: The main Planner/Executor agent.
-   `classifier.py`: The specialist tool that loads the fine-tuned LoRA model.
-   `train.ipynb`: The Google Colab notebook used to train the model.
-   `split_data.py`: Script to split the synthetic dataset.
-   `AI_Agent_Architecture.md`: Architecture report.
-   `Data_Science_Report.md`: Data science and evaluation report.
-   `train.jsonl` / `test.jsonl`: The dataset files.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
-   `.gitignore`: Explicitly ignores large model files.

## How to Run

**Note:** The fine-tuned model (`email-classifier-gemma-2b-lora-final`) is **not** included in this repository due to its large size. It must be generated by running the `train.ipynb` notebook.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Train the Model (if not already done):**
    -   Open the `train.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
    -   Run all cells to train the model.
    -   Download the resulting `email-classifier-gemma-2b-lora-final` folder and place it in this directory.

3.  **Set Environment Variable:**
    You must set your Google AI API key.
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
    
    # On Windows (cmd)
    set GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Run the Agent:**
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```
